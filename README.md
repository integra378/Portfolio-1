# Portfolio-1
The client requested a codebase that follows acessibility standards and a codebase that is optimized for search engines.
I was able to clean up the code and make it easier to maintain using the following methods:
---Applied header and footer
---Applied nav, main, and aside element to create a page with proper sections
---Added alts to images
---Added comments to css
---Replaced div elements with semantic html elements
---Simplified css classes so that the page is styled properly with less classes to look at
---Made sure that links operate correctly
